### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Yudhajit**](https://www.miraya.tech), a software developer based in India.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, feel free to check them out.

I’ve built over 100 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 200 at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I have no pets
* I don’t like coffee or tea
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
* **Hobbies:** anime, books, building things
